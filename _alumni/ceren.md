Deeply fascinated by cognitive neuroimaging, especially fMRI, after having a few experiences with rat studies. As an intern at BIL Lab, I participated in a project mapping the VIP area. I have now started working on my master's thesis at the MPI Doeller Lab, focusing on 'hippocampal activity and neocortical modules during the planning of complex hierarchical sequences' using fMRI and MEG. Besides my studies, playing the piano, traveling, and reading philosophy are my passions.
