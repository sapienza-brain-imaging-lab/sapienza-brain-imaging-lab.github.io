Graduated in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychological Rehabilitation at Sapienza University of Rome, I worked on a thesis exploring effective connectivity in the human brain, using Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to investigate how different regions interact during a working memory task. I'm passionate about music and love spending time in nature.
