I am a MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience and formerly intern in Brain Imaging Lab. Currently, I am taking a role in behavioral part of the Social Grasping experiment. Besides of these, I am a real movie lover. I believe that everyone can get huge amount of knowdlege and details about the cultures with watching their movies, all you need is to choose the right directors.
