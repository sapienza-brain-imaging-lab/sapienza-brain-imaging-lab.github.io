I am a full-time student in the Master's degree program in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychological Rehabilitation at the University of Rome "La Sapienza." Currently, I am actively involved in a rehabilitation project for a patient with reading deficits, using eye movement tracking. My dopamine levels increase when I cook and I have a secret passion for crossword puzzles.
