Currently spending my days and nights as a master's student in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychological Rehabilitation at Sapienza University.  When it comes to my thesis project, I'm investigating the effects of cognitive stimulation training in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, particularly MCI, AD and FTD. Regarding my internship, I'm focusing on prodromal LBD criteria using EEG, fMRI and neuropsychological testing. As we all know, hobbies and free time are necessary to maintain cognitive reserve, and that's why my weekends are completely devoted to clubbing, TV series and a good carbonara.
