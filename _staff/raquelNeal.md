I am a master's student in the Cognitive Neuroscience program with a passion for learning about all things brain and beyond. My current research focuses on identifying regions within the ventral visual cortex to deepen our understanding of the brain's unique and precise capabilities. When I'm not in the lab, you can find me traveling, baking, or embracing the beauty of everyday moments.
