Iâ€™m an MSc student in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychological Rehabilitation at Sapienza University. Currently, I am investigating how reach-to-move actions are represented in visuomotor brain areas, using a combination of fMRI and virtual reality.
Driven by a strong interest in neuroimaging, I am glad to be part of the BIL team and contribute to cutting-edge research. Outside the Lab, you can find me taking long walks in nature, deep in a chess match or enjoying some jazz music.
