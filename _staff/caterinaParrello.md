I am a Master's student in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychological Rehabilitation, currently on an internship at the BIL Lab. Here I am collaborating on a research project combining virtual reality and fMRI, a very stimulating experience that allows me to delve into the workings of the human brain, with all its complexity and wonder. Besides my passion for neuroscience, I love ballet, recharge my batteries in nature, get inspired by personal growth books and travel whenever I can!
