I’m a second-year Master’s student in Cognitive Neuroscience at Sapienza University of Rome.
As part of my internship in the Brain Imaging Lab, I’m working on a paper exploring effective brain connectivity using data from the Human Connectome Project.
I moved from Persia to Rome to grow both academically and personally — and to honor an ancient connection between our two cultures.
When I’m not deep in connectivity models, I’m probably leading walking tours around Rome, binge-watching sitcoms, or planning my next travel adventure.
