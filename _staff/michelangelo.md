I am investigating sensorimotor integration in complex ethologically-relevant behaviours, focusing on kinematic dynamics, action goals and visuomotor interactions. Current projects include reach-to-grasp, movement perception, defensive actions, reach-to-move and limbs integration during navigation. We employ an innovative fMRI setup with a cutting-edge motion tracking system, which streams kinematics in real-time to virtual reality. My research interests involve brain mapping of sensorimotor circuitry, predictive coding and sensorimotor grounding of the so-called higher order functions. I am a curious guy by nature, I listen to hardcore punk and I love adventure travel.
