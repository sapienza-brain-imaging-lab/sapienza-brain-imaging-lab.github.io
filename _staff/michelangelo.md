I am investigating sensorimotor integration of goal-directed arm reaching actions, including reach-to-grasp, reach-to-move and defensive actions. We use an innovative fMRI setup with a cutting-edge motion tracking system, which records and streams kinematics in real-time to virtual reality. My current research interests are the neural circuitry underlying ethological behaviours, predictive coding and sensorimotor grounding of the so-called higher-order functions. I tend to be quite curious about things, I listen to hardcore punk and I love adventure travel.
