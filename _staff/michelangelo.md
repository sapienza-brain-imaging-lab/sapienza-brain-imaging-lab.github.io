I am currently investigating sensorimotor integration of arm-reaching actions with different goals, such as reach-to-grasp, reach-to-move and defensive actions. We use an innovative fMRI setup with a cutting-edge motion tracking system, which streams kinematics in real-time to virtual reality. My main research interests are the neural circuitry underlying ethological behaviours, predictive coding and sensorimotor grounding of the so-called higher-order functions. I am a curious guy, I listen to hardcore punk and I love adventure travel.
