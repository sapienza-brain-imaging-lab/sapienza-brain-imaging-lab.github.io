I investigate sensorimotor integration during execution and observation of complex behaviours, such as reach-to-grasp, reach-to-move and defensive actions, as well as locomotion. We use an innovative fMRI setup with a cutting-edge motion tracking system, which streams kinematics in real-time to virtual reality. My main research interests regard neural circuitry underlying ethological behaviour, predictive coding and sensorimotor grounding of the so-called higher-order functions. I am a curious guy, I listen to hardcore punk and I love adventure travel.
