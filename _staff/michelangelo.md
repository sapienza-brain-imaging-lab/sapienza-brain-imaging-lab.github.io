I investigate sensorimotor integration in complex, ethologically relevant behaviors, with a focus on kinematic dynamics, action goals, and visuomotor interactions. My current projects include reach-to-grasp and reach-to-move actions, movement perception, defensive actions and gait in navigation. We use an innovative fMRI setup with a cutting-edge motion tracking system, which streams kinematics in real-time to virtual reality and record them. My research interests involve brain mapping of sensorimotor circuitry, predictive coding and sensorimotor grounding of the so-called higher-order functions. I am a curious guy by nature, I listen to hardcore punk and I love adventure travel.
