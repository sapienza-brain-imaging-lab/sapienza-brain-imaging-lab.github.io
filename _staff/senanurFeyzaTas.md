I’m a Master’s student in Cognitive Neuroscience, currently writing my thesis on the flow parsing hypothesis. Despite having failed my driving test more than once, I’m also involved in a research project exploring how cognitive workload and attention affect driving performance. Beyond neuroscience, I love wandering the streets of Rome—almost like a flâneur—spending time in nature, and growing plants. While I enjoy diving into how the brain works, I also write simple and relatable pieces for a psychology platform.
