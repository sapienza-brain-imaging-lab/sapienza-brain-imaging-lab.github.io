I am a student in the cognitive science field, deeply fascinated by exploring the brain and mind from an interdisciplinary perspective. Currently, I am working on a project investigating the functional organization of the ventral visual cortex using fMRI. Living in a world that revolves around brains, boats, and booksâ€”I spend sunny days sailing and cold ones diving into historical fiction.
